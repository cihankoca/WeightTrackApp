WeightTrackApp - Project Three Submission
App Overview
The WeightTrackApp is a mobile application designed to help users track their daily weight, set goals, and visualize progress. Key functionalities include weight logging, goal tracking with a dynamic progress bar, and motivational SMS notifications. The app uses a user-centered design approach to deliver a simple and intuitive experience.

User-Centered Design
The app was developed with the userâ€™s needs in mind, focusing on simplicity and usability. Essential screens included:

Login and Registration: Secure access for new and returning users.
Dashboard: Displays current weight, progress bar, and weight trends with interactive charts.
Add Weight Screen: Allows users to log weights and check progress toward their goals.
Account Page: Enables users to update their phone number, toggle SMS notifications, and manage profiles. These designs followed Material Design principles, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
Coding Process
Development began by breaking down tasks into smaller components, such as user authentication, database integration, and feature-specific functionalities. Each feature was developed incrementally and tested using the Android Emulator to ensure functionality. Thorough documentation and consistent in-line comments were maintained to enhance code readability.

Testing and Debugging
The app underwent unit testing, edge case testing (e.g., invalid inputs or denied permissions), and UI testing for responsiveness across devices. This process was critical to identifying and resolving issues, such as SMS permission handling and input validation. While some known issues remain, such as outdated weight display on the dashboard, these are planned for future updates.

Overcoming Challenges
A significant challenge was managing the dynamic updates for the dashboard and progress bar. While the implementation of real-time updates was not fully achieved, a plan to address this in future releases is in place, as noted in the post-launch roadmap.

Key Achievements
One of the standout features is the seamless integration of SMS notifications, which combines permissions management, shared preferences, and meaningful user engagement. This feature reflects an understanding of both technical functionality and user-centered principles.
